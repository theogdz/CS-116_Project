# CS-116_Project
PROJECT INFO: <br />
● Design a program which will take 2 types of appliances: Smart and Regular appliances. <br />
● Store the appliances in a single database. <br />
● Run test cases to optimize the power usage of all the appliances. <br />
● The first power saving step is to set smart devices on low power. <br />
● If all smart devices are on low power and the total power is still above the limit, implement an algorithm to burn out locations until total power is below the limit.<br />
